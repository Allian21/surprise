            <h1>Hi cinthie,</h1>
            <p>
                I don’t even know where to start, but I just want you to know how much you mean to me. 
                No matter how busy I get or whatever happens in my life, you are always on my mind. 
                You’re the first person I think of when I wake up and the last before I sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ve been through so much. We’ve had ups and downs, we’ve hurt each other, but look at us—we’re still here. 
                Things may not be the same as before, but your presence in my life is still different from anyone else’s. 
                You’ve always been there for me, and I truly appreciate that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I know we’ve both changed, but there’s one thing that hasn’t: you are still the person I want to talk to after a long day. 
                You’re the one who understands me the most, the one who’s seen every version of me—the good and the bad. 
                And even after everything, you never left.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I just have one question for you. No pressure, no expectations.  
                Just scroll down...
